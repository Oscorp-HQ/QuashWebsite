              Vendors, Consultants and Other Third-Party Service Providers:
              Quash, like many businesses, sometimes hires other companies to

              companies, providers of digital advertising services, our hosting
              and cloud computing service providers, providers of CRM, marketing
              and sales software solutions, providers of billing and processing
              payments functions. When we employ another company to perform a
              function of this nature, we only provide them with the information
              that they need to perform their specific functions. Pursuant to
              our instructions, these parties may access, process or store
              Personal Data in the course of performing their duties to us and
              solely in order to perform the services we have hired them to

              Protection of Quash and Others: We may release Personal Data when
              we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with
              the law; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other
              agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Quash,

            </li>
            <li>
              Business Transfers: If Quash or substantially all of its assets
              were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Quash goes out of
              business or enters bankruptcy, Personal Data about our customers
              would be one of the assets that are transferred or acquired by a
