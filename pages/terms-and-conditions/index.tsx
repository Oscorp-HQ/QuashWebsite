            Conditions, or any provisions therein, the parties shall resolve the
            dispute through final and binding arbitration, as governed by the
            Indian Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. The arbitration will
            be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator, administered by an
            arbitration service chosen by the parties and compliant with Indian
            laws. The parties agree to arbitrate all disputes, whether directly
            or indirectly related to these Terms and Conditions, including Tort
            claims. The arbitrator‚Äôs award will be final, and judgment may be
            entered in any court with jurisdiction in India.
          </p>

          <p>
            This amendment aligns the arbitration process with Indian
            regulations and legal procedures.

            Class Action Waiver

            individual basis, and class arbitrations or
            class/representative/collective actions are not permitted. The
            parties agree that claims can only be brought in an individual
            capacity and not as part of any class, collective, or representative
            action. Unless both parties agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not
            consolidate more than one person‚Äôs claims or preside over any
            representative or class proceeding.

            discontinue using the site.
